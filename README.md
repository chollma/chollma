### Hi, I'm Cooper Hollmaier (<a href="https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/">He/His</a>). 👋

I'm a technical product manager based in Tacoma, WA. I have a deep passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible by default.

A recent transplant to the Pacific Northwest, you can find me, my wife, and our two dogs exploring all that Washington has to offer. Whether it's a new local restaurant, hiking trail, or ski slope, we're always down for an adventure.

I started my career in 2015 as a marketing coordinator for a transportation and gas-price signage company. An insatiable desire to learn and move faster led me to the "agency-life," helping small and large businesses earn more visibility online.

Today I work alongside a talented and passionate group of folks at a large specialty outdoor retailer, bringing our vision of inclusive participation and accessibility to life.

## Current projects:
- Supporting accessibility at <a href="https://www.rei.com">Recreational Equipment, Inc.</a>
- Educating others on how accessibility impacts their daily life.
- Advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion.
