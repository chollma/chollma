### Hi, I'm Cooper Hollmaier (<a href="https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/">He/His</a>). 👋

I'm an experienced product leader, speaker, and mentor. I advocate for systemic solutions to business and customer problems that are fast and accessible by default. You can find my work featured in The A11y Project, A11y Weekly, and at CSUN: The Assistive Technology Conference. 

I'm passionate about:
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion
- Organizational change management
- Product management
- Assistive technologies
- Semantics and interoperability
- Accessible and inclusive design
- Accessible data visualization
- Environmentalism


Looking for a contributor with experience in accessibility, search engine optimization, or remote work? I'm currently available for speaking, writing, teaching, and consulting. Get in touch!
